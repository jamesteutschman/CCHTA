# Clinical Setup Guide — CCHTA

This document describes how a healthcare practice establishes the Comprehensive Collaborative Health Treatment Architecture.

---

## Purpose

Provide operational steps for integrating regulatory-based treatment into existing clinical environments.

---

## Core Principle

CCHTA is layered onto existing medical practice.

It does not replace diagnostics or standard care.

It reorganizes treatment focus toward regulatory stability.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Staff Orientation

All clinical staff receive training in:

- regulatory system model
- symptom interpretation as system output
- patient autonomy principles
- co-regulation awareness
- stabilization-first treatment philosophy

---

### Patient Entry Structure

Every patient begins with:

1. full narrative intake
2. safety and risk screening
3. baseline regulatory assessment
4. system model explanation
5. collaborative stabilization plan

---

### Environment Design

Clinical space should support:

- reduced sensory overload
- clear communication
- predictable process flow
- patient control where possible

Goal:
Lower perceived threat.

---

### Measurement System Activation

Clinics track:

- baseline stability markers
- regulation skill acquisition
- functional capacity change
- patient understanding level

Symptoms are monitored as outputs, not primary targets.

---

### Provider Role

Providers function as:

- regulators of treatment pace
- interpreters of system signals
- educators of regulatory principles
- co-regulation anchors when needed

Authority shifts from directive control to collaborative guidance.

---

### Patient Role

Patients participate as:

- observers of internal state
- learners of regulation skill
- partners in decision-making

---

## Progression Model

Movement between treatment phases is based on:

observed stability  
not elapsed time  
not symptom disappearance  

---

## Safety Escalation

If instability increases:

- reduce demand
- simplify regulation tasks
- reassess environmental stressors
- evaluate medical risk if indicated

---

## Integration with Standard Care

Diagnostic testing, medication, and specialty referral continue normally.

CCHTA modifies how results are interpreted and applied.

---

## Implementation Goal

Create a clinical environment that supports:

regulatory stability  
adaptive learning  
functional restoration  
long-term resilience
