# Provider Training Curriculum — CCHTA

This document defines the knowledge and competency requirements for clinicians implementing the Comprehensive Collaborative Health Treatment Architecture.

Providers must demonstrate conceptual, observational, and relational competency.

Technical knowledge alone is insufficient.

---

## Training Objective

Providers must be able to:

- interpret symptoms as regulatory outputs
- recognize stability vs instability patterns
- maintain non-threatening clinical presence
- guide gradual adaptation processes
- collaborate with patients as system participants

---

## Core Conceptual Modules

### 1. Regulatory Systems Model

Understanding:

- autonomic regulation
- adaptive response patterns
- system stabilization principles
- symptom generation mechanisms

Focus:
Dynamic system behavior, not disease labeling.

---

### 2. Stability-Based Treatment Progression

Understanding:

- pacing and load tolerance
- non-linear recovery patterns
- regression as adaptation
- threshold detection

Providers must avoid intensity-driven treatment models.

---

### 3. Clinical Presence and Safety Signaling

Training includes:

- voice regulation
- pacing of interaction
- predictability behaviors
- environmental awareness
- physical touch boundaries and use

Provider state influences patient regulatory response.

---

### 4. Observational Pattern Recognition

Providers learn to observe:

- breathing mechanics
- muscle tone changes
- cognitive processing speed
- emotional variability
- fatigue indicators
- autonomic activation signs

Assessment is pattern-based, not score-dependent.

---

### 5. Collaborative Communication

Skills include:

- non-authoritative explanation
- transparent reasoning
- uncertainty communication
- shared decision structure
- patient model education

Information is never withheld to maintain authority.

---

### 6. Intervention Minimalism

Providers must learn:

- smallest effective change principle
- stabilization before modification
- environmental adjustment priority
- pacing over forcing adaptation

Over-intervention increases instability.

---

## Practical Training Components

- simulated patient scenarios
- stability assessment exercises
- environmental modulation practice
- guided interaction review
- supervision of real clinical encounters

---

## Competency Evaluation

Providers must demonstrate ability to:

1. establish safety within first interaction
2. accurately identify instability patterns
3. explain regulatory model clearly
4. design low-load stabilization plan
5. maintain collaborative treatment stance

Evaluation is observational and performance-based.

---

## Certification Requirement

Provider certification requires:

- conceptual mastery
- observed clinical competence
- adherence to transparency principles
- demonstrated patient stabilization outcomes

Certification is revoked if deceptive or coercive practices occur.

---

## Ongoing Development

Providers engage in:

- periodic supervision
- outcome review
- peer collaboration
- continuing education in regulatory science

Learning is continuous.
