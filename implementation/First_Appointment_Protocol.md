# First Appointment Protocol — CCHTA

This document defines the structure of the initial patient encounter within the Comprehensive Collaborative Health Treatment Architecture.

The purpose of the first appointment is stabilization, orientation, and trust formation.

Diagnosis is not the primary objective of this visit.

---

## Core Goals

1. Establish psychological and physiological safety
2. Understand the patient’s lived experience
3. Assess baseline regulatory function
4. Introduce the regulatory system model
5. Form a collaborative stabilization plan

---

## Phase 1 — Environment Stabilization

Provider ensures:

- calm pacing
- minimal interruption
- clear explanation of process
- patient control over physical comfort

Patient must experience predictability and non-threat.

---

## Phase 2 — Full Narrative Intake

Patient is invited to describe:

- symptom history
- onset patterns
- stress relationships
- medical history
- functional impact
- prior treatment experiences

Provider listens without premature interpretation.

Goal:
Understand system behavior over time.

---

## Phase 3 — Safety and Risk Assessment

Evaluate:

- acute medical risk
- psychiatric risk
- functional instability
- environmental stress exposure

If urgent risk is present, stabilization takes priority over all other steps.

---

## Phase 4 — Baseline Regulatory Observation

Provider assesses:

- breathing pattern
- muscle tension
- autonomic reactivity
- cognitive pacing
- emotional variability
- fatigue markers

No formal scoring required.

Purpose is pattern recognition.

---

## Phase 5 — System Model Orientation

Provider explains:

- symptoms as regulatory outputs
- stability as treatment target
- gradual adaptation process
- collaborative treatment structure

Patient must understand:

Nothing is “failing.”
The system is responding.

---

## Phase 6 — Initial Stabilization Plan

Create simple, achievable practices such as:

- breathing regulation
- pacing adjustments
- environmental modifications
- rest structure
- symptom observation methods

Plan must be low demand.

Success builds safety.

---

## Phase 7 — Expectation Alignment

Provider clarifies:

- progress is stability-based
- fluctuations are normal
- effort intensity does not equal improvement
- learning takes time

Predictability reduces threat response.

---

## Phase 8 — Closing Integration

Patient summarizes understanding.

Provider confirms:

- safety perception
- clarity of next steps
- confidence in collaboration

---

## Appointment Outcome

By the end of the first visit, the patient should experience:

increased safety  
reduced uncertainty  
clear conceptual model  
achievable starting actions  

If these are not present, the system foundation is incomplete.
