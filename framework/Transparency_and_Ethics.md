# Transparency and Ethics — CCHTA

Transparency is a physiological safety mechanism.

Information withholding increases uncertainty, threat perception,
and autonomic activation.

Open communication supports regulatory stability.

---

## Core Ethical Principles

- full disclosure of clinical reasoning
- explanation of uncertainty
- shared access to data
- collaborative interpretation
- informed participation in decision-making

---

## Information Sharing Standard

Patients are informed of:

- observations
- interpretations
- hypotheses
- treatment rationale
- risks and limitations
- alternative approaches

No clinically relevant information is intentionally withheld.

---

## Decision Transparency

When providers disagree or uncertainty exists,
this is communicated openly.

Ambiguity is explained rather than concealed.

---

## Patient Autonomy

Patients are active participants in:

- understanding system state
- evaluating intervention options
- selecting regulation strategies
- defining functional goals

---

## Therapeutic Rationale

Transparency increases perceived safety.

Perceived safety stabilizes autonomic function.

Stabilized physiology improves learning, regulation, and recovery.

---

## Ethical Foundation

Trust is not assumed.
Trust is built through consistent transparency.
