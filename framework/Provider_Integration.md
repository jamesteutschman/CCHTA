# Provider Integration — CCHTA

Healthcare providers function as a coordinated regulatory support team.

Treatment responsibility is distributed according to expertise,
but unified under a shared regulatory framework.

---

## Core Principles

- shared conceptual model
- transparent communication
- collaborative decision-making
- patient participation in interpretation
- role clarity without hierarchy dominance

---

## Provider Roles

### Medical Providers
Assess physiological safety, manage biological stabilization,
and monitor medical risk factors.

---

### Mental Health Providers
Support interpretation recalibration, emotional regulation,
and cognitive stabilization.

---

### Rehabilitation Specialists
Guide functional reintegration and physical capacity expansion.

---

### Patient
Primary observer of internal system state and active regulation participant.

---

## Communication Structure

Providers share:

- system state observations
- stability trends
- treatment responses
- functional capacity changes

Information is openly shared with the patient.

---

## Decision Model

Treatment decisions are based on:

- physiological safety status
- stability indicators
- patient-reported experience
- functional performance

No single domain overrides the others without explicit justification.

---

## Care Coordination

Care is adjusted dynamically in response to regulatory patterns.

Intervention intensity increases with instability
and decreases with autonomous regulation.

---

## Goal

Integrated support of a single adaptive system rather than parallel treatment tracks.
