# Measurement Framework — CCHTA

CCHTA measures regulatory dynamics rather than isolated symptoms.

Measurement focuses on system behavior over time.

## Core Measurement Domains

### Physiological State
Observed body function patterns.

Examples:
- breathing patterns
- muscle tension
- autonomic activation
- sleep quality
- fatigue levels

---

### Interoceptive Signal Intensity
Strength of internal sensations as experienced by the patient.

Examples:
- air hunger
- pressure
- discomfort
- dizziness
- sensory amplification

Measured using qualitative descriptors rather than numeric scoring.

---

### Interpretation State
Meaning assigned to internal signals.

Tracked as:
- threat perception
- uncertainty tolerance
- confidence in safety
- catastrophic vs neutral labeling

---

### Regulation Response Effectiveness
How well stabilization strategies work.

Tracked by:
- ease of state shift
- speed of recovery
- effort required
- reliability of response

---

### Functional Capacity
Real-world performance ability.

Examples:
- activity duration tolerance
- cognitive endurance
- environmental tolerance
- social participation

---

### Adaptation Trajectory
Long-term change patterns.

Tracked by:
- baseline stability trends
- trigger sensitivity changes
- recovery speed trends
- regulation automaticity

---

## Stability Indicators

Primary indicators of improvement:

- reduced fluctuation amplitude
- fewer dysregulation events
- faster recovery
- less effort required for stabilization

---

## Data Collection Sources

- patient self-report
- clinical observation
- functional testing
- wearable monitoring (optional)

---

## Measurement Principle

Progress is defined by increasing stability, adaptability, and autonomy.

Symptom absence is not required for recovery.
