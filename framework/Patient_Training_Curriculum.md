# Patient Training Curriculum — CCHTA

Patients are trained as active regulators of their internal system.

Education is a therapeutic intervention, not supplemental information.

Training is progressive and stability-based.

---

## Stage 1 — System Understanding

Patient learns:

- regulatory model of health
- relationship between physiology and perception
- safety vs threat signaling
- role of interpretation
- principles of gradual adaptation

Outcome:
Patient understands symptoms as system signals.

---

## Stage 2 — Internal Signal Awareness

Patient develops ability to notice:

- breathing patterns
- muscle tension
- autonomic activation
- sensory shifts
- fatigue signals

Outcome:
Earlier detection of state change.

---

## Stage 3 — Regulation Skill Development

Patient learns and practices:

- breathing modulation
- posture and muscle release
- sensory grounding
- pacing and recovery cycles
- environmental regulation

Outcome:
Intentional state change becomes possible.

---

## Stage 4 — Interpretation Stabilization

Patient practices:

- neutral labeling of sensations
- distinguishing discomfort from danger
- uncertainty tolerance
- non-catastrophic response patterns

Outcome:
Reduced amplification of signals.

---

## Stage 5 — Functional Capacity Expansion

Patient learns:

- graded exposure
- activity pacing
- recovery planning
- threshold awareness

Outcome:
Increased real-world tolerance.

---

## Stage 6 — Autonomous Regulation

Patient develops:

- early intervention strategies
- personalized regulation plans
- adaptive monitoring habits

Outcome:
Independent stability management.

---

## Training Principles

- gradual progression
- low force, high consistency
- safety-first pacing
- collaborative adjustment
- learning through experience

Regression is treated as feedback, not failure.
