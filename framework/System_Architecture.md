# System Architecture — CCHTA

Human health is a dynamic regulatory system rather than a collection of isolated symptoms.

CCHTA models health as a continuous adaptive loop:

Physiological State  
→ Interoceptive Signals  
→ Interpretation  
→ Regulation Response  
→ Functional Capacity  
→ Adaptive Learning  

Environmental context and interpersonal interaction influence all stages.

Each stage feeds back into the others, forming a self-adjusting regulatory system.

Symptoms are not isolated failures.  
They are outputs of regulatory dynamics.

Treatment therefore focuses on stabilizing regulation, improving interpretation accuracy,
developing reliable response capability, and expanding functional capacity.

Recovery is defined by increased stability, faster recovery from disturbance,
and autonomous regulation across environments.
