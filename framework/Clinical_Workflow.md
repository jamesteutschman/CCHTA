# Clinical Workflow — CCHTA

Treatment follows a structured regulatory progression rather than symptom suppression.

Progression is stability-based, not time-based.

---

## Phase 1 — Entry and System Orientation

Goals:
- establish safety
- gather baseline information
- explain regulatory model
- reduce uncertainty

Actions:
- full patient narrative
- physiological risk assessment
- distress and control assessment
- system model education

Outcome:
Patient understands symptoms as signals and treatment as regulation.

---

## Phase 2 — Physiological Stabilization

Goals:
Reduce survival activation and autonomic overload.

Interventions may include:
- breathing regulation training
- physical rest
- sleep support
- hydration and nutrition stabilization
- environmental load reduction
- medication if necessary

Outcome:
Baseline activation decreases. System becomes responsive to learning.

---

## Phase 3 — Interoceptive Mapping

Goals:
Develop accurate internal signal awareness.

Patient learns to track:
- sensation types
- intensity patterns
- triggers
- recovery timeline

Outcome:
Patient distinguishes fluctuation from escalation.

---

## Phase 4 — Interpretation Recalibration

Goals:
Adjust meaning assigned to internal signals.

Patient learns:
- predictive brain function
- sensitivity vs danger distinction
- non-catastrophic interpretation

Outcome:
Signals become informational rather than threatening.

---

## Phase 5 — Regulation Skill Acquisition

Goals:
Develop reliable state-shifting ability.

Skills include:
- breathing modulation
- posture adjustment
- muscle relaxation
- sensory grounding
- pacing strategies

Outcome:
Patient can intentionally reduce dysregulation.

---

## Phase 6 — Functional Reintegration

Goals:
Restore real-world activity capacity.

Process:
- graded exposure
- activity pacing
- recovery monitoring
- threshold expansion

Outcome:
Functional tolerance increases.

---

## Phase 7 — Adaptive Monitoring and Maintenance

Goals:
Long-term stability and autonomy.

Patient develops:
- early signal detection
- rapid self-stabilization
- independent regulation planning

Outcome:
Healthcare shifts from intervention to partnership.

---

## Escalation Response

If instability increases:

1. reassess physiological safety
2. reapply stabilization
3. review interpretation patterns
4. reinforce regulation skills
5. adjust functional load

Regression is treated as data, not failure.
