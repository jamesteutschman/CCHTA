# Comprehensive Collaborative Health Treatment Architecture (CCHTA)
## Master Index

This repository contains the full structural, clinical, and conceptual framework for the Comprehensive Collaborative Health Treatment Architecture.

CCHTA is a stability-based, regulatory-centered model of healthcare delivery designed to replace symptom-suppression paradigms with system restoration approaches.

## Repository Structure

### Framework

Core theoretical and operational structure of the system.

- Core_Axioms.md  
  Foundational principles governing the model.

- System_Architecture.md  
  Structural overview of how system components interact.

- Clinical_Workflow.md  
  Treatment progression model.

- Measurement_Framework.md  
  Stability-based assessment model.

- Patient_Training_Curriculum.md  
  Patient education and self-regulation development.

- Provider_Integration.md  
  Integration of clinicians into the collaborative model.

- Transparency_and_Ethics.md  
  Ethical operating principles.

---

### Implementation

Practical guidance for real-world deployment.

- Clinical_Setup_Guide.md  
  Environmental and operational preparation.

- First_Appointment_Protocol.md  
  Initial clinical encounter procedure.

- Provider_Training_Curriculum.md  
  Required clinician knowledge and competency.

---

### Case Models

Application examples.

- Generalized_Clinical_Case.md  
  Standardized model of system use.

- Lived_Experience_Case.md  
  Real-world application narrative.

---

### Publication

Formal presentation materials.

- CCHTA_White_Paper.md

---

## Model Orientation

CCHTA treats symptoms as outputs of regulatory dynamics rather than isolated pathology.

Treatment focus:
- stabilization
- adaptive capacity restoration
- collaborative participation
- transparency of process

Progression is stability-based, not time-based.

---

## Intended Use

This framework may be used for:

- clinical implementation
- research development
- educational training
- systems design
- healthcare model evaluation
