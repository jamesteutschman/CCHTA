# Generalized Clinical Case — CCHTA Application

## Patient Profile

Adult experiencing persistent physiological distress without acute pathology.

Common symptoms:

- air hunger sensation
- fatigue
- autonomic activation
- sleep disruption
- health anxiety
- reduced functional tolerance

Medical testing shows no immediate danger.

System condition: regulatory instability with high threat interpretation.

---

## Phase 1 — Entry and Orientation

Patient reports fear of serious medical condition.

Intervention:
- safety assessment
- regulatory model explanation

Outcome:
Initial reduction in uncertainty.

---

## Phase 2 — Physiological Stabilization

Interventions:
- breathing regulation
- rest support
- environmental calming

Outcome:
Baseline activation decreases.

---

## Phase 3 — Interoceptive Mapping

Patient learns to observe:

- sensation patterns
- triggers
- recovery time

Outcome:
Distinction between fluctuation and escalation.

---

## Phase 4 — Interpretation Recalibration

Education on:

- sensitivity vs danger
- predictive brain response

Outcome:
Reduced catastrophic interpretation.

---

## Phase 5 — Regulation Skill Development

Patient practices:

- breathing control
- muscle release
- pacing

Outcome:
Intentional stabilization possible.

---

## Phase 6 — Functional Reintegration

Gradual activity expansion.

Outcome:
Increased capacity.

---

## Phase 7 — Autonomous Regulation

Patient self-monitors and self-stabilizes.

Healthcare becomes supportive rather than corrective.

---

## Outcome

Stable baseline  
accurate interpretation  
reliable regulation  
restored function
